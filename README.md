# Gigabit-101-Workshop

## INTRO

**The Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund (https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/gigabit/) provides grant funding in select U.S. communities to support pilot tests of gigabit technologies such as:**

- *virtual reality;*
- *4K video;*
- *artificial intelligence;*

**In so doing, our goal is to:**

- *increase participation in technology innovation in support of a healthy Internet where all people are empowered, safe, and independent online.*

**As part of the work, it became evident that while many people are aware of whether or not they have high-speed internet access, they may not know what it enables them to do in a classroom or in general.**

**We created this workshop as a way to:**

- *begin answering questions;*
- *highlighting some of the ways it's being used now;*
- *help people think about how they might leverage it for their own projects and purposes;*

**The workshop has worked well for facilitated groups of 20-30 participants.**

## GET STARTED

**There are two files in the Activity Scripts folder:**

- *one is a slide deck that a facilitator can use to walk through the activities;*
- *the other is a sample agenda that references the potential order of activities;*

**Each activity guide, and the sample agenda, references items that need to be printed for each corresponding activity. 
Printed items are available in the Printable Workshop Materials folder.**

## Sample description/invitation to workshop:

**What does the promise of a high-speed internet network mean for your city/school/organization, and how can you help define the impact of this network on your community?**

**High-speed networks with their seemingly unlimited capacity and lightning-fast connections can bring a lot of power to a community from:**

- *enhancing public health;*
- *improving transportation infrastructure;*
- *bringing new opportunities for learning;*

**But, what do you do with it? And, how can you actually leverage these connections to create opportunity and improve quality of life?**

**Join us from [time] [date] for a workshop focused on demystifying high-speed internet, and help you shape the story of high-speed networks for [your community].**
